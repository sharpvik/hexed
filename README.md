# Hexed Color Utility

Hexed is a colour utility that allows you to play with color like you play hard
to get. All in a simple UI that everyone understands!

## How to Use

like the color? Not a problem! Tap on its hex value and input your own hex code.
With *Hexed* you can try 'em all!

## How to Run

Get yourself a copy of this repo and open *index.html* in your own browser or
simply go to `sharpvik.github.io` and if you are lucky enough, this utility is
still up there.
